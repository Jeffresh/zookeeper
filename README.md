# Zookeeper
 A tool for monitoring animals and their status.
 
 # Description

There are many animals in the zoo: all of them need care, and some of them are endangered and require preservation efforts. Animals must be fed, cleaned, surrounded by their kin, and kept happy. That is a difficult task for such a big open-range zoo, so one of your employers suggested a better way to accomplish that. She wants to be able to watch any animal on the screen with the help of a special program.

In this project, you will create a program that helps the zookeeper check on the animals and see that they're well. Your product will be able to understand commands from the zoo staff and show the animals on the monitor.

The important thing about working with animals is watching them. We need to see the animals on the screen to know how they are doing, right? At this time, we are ready to print something awesome: animal images!

     |                                '',
      ',,-,                           ':;
           ',,| ;,,                 ,' ;;

             ; ;   ! !      ! !  ; ;   ;,
            ; ;    ! !     ! !   ; ;
            ; ;    ! !    ! !     ; ;

```

The third stage brings new abilities for your software: it will be able to recognize the number of a specific habitat from the input and show the animals living there.

Add all variables with images from the template to a variable with the type list. The order of variables matters: they must be in the order they're defined in the code. The list must contain all of them with no duplicates.

In this final stage, your software will be ready for use by the zoo staff. Your program should understand the habitat numbers, show the animals, and be able to work infinitely.

# Objectives

These are your tasks at this point:

    Your program should repeat the behavior from the previous stage, now in a loop.
    Do not forget to add an exit opportunity for the program: inputting the word exit must terminate the program.
    At the end of execution, it must print See you!.
